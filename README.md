# store_aggregator

Store Aggregator is new approch to the future grocery and medicine shopping helps users to purchase Grocery/Medicine online without visitng the store. It is helpful for the elders and busy people so they can buy the grocery and medicine without visiting the store and will be deliver at home in very less time.

The most important feature in the webapp is 1 hour delivery. If yor are buying something from store in radius of 5 miles from your location then it will be delivered withing an hour.

I have used the Google Map API to calculate real time distance of customer and vendor location so that customer can always look the distance from where they are buying those products.
